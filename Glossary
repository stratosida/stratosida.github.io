### Initial Data Analysis

The main aim of IDA is seen in providing reliable knowledge about the data to enable responsible statistical analyses and interpretation. 
IDA has the following phases: (1) metadata setup; (2) data cleaning; (3) data screening; (4) initial data reporting; 
(5) refining and updating the research analysis plan; and (6) documenting and reporting IDA.â€¯IDA is aligned with the research aims 
and the statistical analysis plan and does not include hypothesis generating activities.
