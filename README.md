# Initial Data Analysis

## Aim of STRATOS Topic Group 3
To improve awareness of Initial Data Analysis (IDA) as an important part of the research process and to provide guidance on conducting IDA in a systematic and reproducible manner. 

## Key principle
IDA does not look at associations of covariates with the outcome. The aim is to provide reliable knowledge about the data to ensure transparency and integrity of preconditions to conduct appropriate statistical analyses and correct interpretation of the results to answer pre-defined research questions.

## STRATOS Initiative
Topic group 3 is a member of the STRATOS Initiative (STRengthening Analytical Thinking for Observational Studies) which is a large collaboration of experts in many different areas of biostatistical research. Ongoing research, discussions and activities within STRATOS are conducted in nine topic groups and several cross-cutting panels. Website: https://www.stratos-initiative.org
