It may involve acquiring, integrating, enriching, transforming, standardizing, checking, cleaning, formatting or structuring, or sampling data. Two phases may be distinguished, such as processes before the analyst receives the data, and activities to prepare an analysis-ready dataset by the analyst.\n\n\nData wrangling\nData Wrangling is a broad term referring to the processes involved when preparing data for analysis. It can include acquiring data, enriching, changing the format and shape of the data, combining, subsetting and sampling data, and cleaning data. Some common steps involved with Data Wrangling are: \n\nDiscovering and gathering the data needed\nMerging data from different sources, if necessary \nFixing flaws in the data entries \nExtracting the necessary data and put it in the proper structure \nStoring it in the proper format for further use\n\nSource: National Library of Medicine\nLink\n\n\nData cleaning\nData cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting data that are inaccurate, missing, or incomplete. Data cleaning tasks can include removing duplicate records, investigating extreme values (e.g., outliers), converting dates from one format to another, removing unwanted text, splitting multiple data points in a cell into separate cells, or coding missing or NA values.\nSource: National Library of Medicine\nLink\n\n\nData screening\nData screening consists of reviewing and documenting the properties and quality of the data that may affect future analysis and interpretation.\nSource: Huebner M, le Cessie S, Schmidt CO, Vach W. A contemporary conceptual framework for initial data analysis. Observational Studies 2018; 4: 171-192.\nLink\n\n\nStructural variables\nStructural variables are variables that help to structure initial data analysis results for a clear organization and essential overview of data properties. Structuring can be based on levels of measurement (centers), on calendar time of recruitment, on demographic variables such as sex or age, or on variables of central importance to the research questions. Structural variables may or may not be included as predictors in the statistical models.\nSource: [Heinze et al https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-024-02294-3]",

A systematic plan of IDA activities (IDAP) should be incoporated in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Ideally, IDA should already be performed during ongoing data collections to detect and deal with data issues as early as possible.",
