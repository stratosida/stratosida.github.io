### **Supplementary material**

The Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) consists of data on health and socioeconomic variables of non-institutionalized individuals aged 50 and older across several European countries. The data sets includes about 140 000 men and women, ages 50 or older, collected in years 2004 to 2018. The questionnaires include questions on demographics, health (physical, and mental health, cognitive function, grip strength and behavioral risks), and socio-economic status. <https://share-eric.eu>

## Project: Systematic review of IDA reporting

### **Project description**

Our aim was to describe the practice of reporting of initial data analyses in observational studies in five highly ranked medical journals with focus on data cleaning, screening, and reporting of findings which led to a potential change in the analysis plan.

Authors: Marianne Huebner, Werner Vach, Saskia le Cessie, Carsten Oliver Schmidt, Lara Lusa

Project status: **CLOSED**
